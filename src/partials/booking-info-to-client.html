<h4>What's Next?</h4>

<p>We have added your booking to the drivers schedule. You will be met at the airport with a sign indicating your name. If there are passengers with the same route, they will be added to you as companions. You can also find companions yourself and agree to go together.</p>

<h4>What about Cashback?</h4>

<p>When you meet with the driver he will inform you if there is a companion for your trip. If there is a companion, you will receive a cashback within 24 hours.</p>
